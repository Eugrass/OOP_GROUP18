\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Represents a road built by a player in the game. 

The {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_road}{Road}} class inherits from the {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_building}{Building}} class and represents a road that a player can construct. Each road is associated with a player and has a color representing the player\textquotesingle{}s identity. Roads play a crucial role in the game, connecting settlements and cities, and contributing to the player\textquotesingle{}s potential for achieving the Longest \doxylink{class_road}{Road} victory condition.
