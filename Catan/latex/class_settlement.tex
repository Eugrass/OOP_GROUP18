\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Represents a settlement built by a player in the game. 

The {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_settlement}{Settlement}} class inherits from the {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_building}{Building}} class and represents a settlement that a player can build on the game board. Each settlement is owned by a player and is associated with a specific color representing the player. Settlements can generate resources based on the surrounding hex tiles, and they play a critical role in the development and expansion of the player.
